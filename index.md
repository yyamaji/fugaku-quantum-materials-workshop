# Scope

Because of development of scientific measurements, theory, and algorithms to analyze quantum many-body systems synchronized with growth of computational resources, new trends for materials science emerge, such as accurate ab initio numerical approaches, and data scientific, as well as machine learning approaches bridging numerical and experimental studies for correlated electron systems. New generation exaflops scale supercomputers, including Fugaku that has just begun running in Kobe, Japan, will accelerate the trends.
To develop close and fruitful co-operations in the world among theoretical, numerical, and experimental researchers who study on the physics of correlated electron systems, we will organize an international web workshop.

The scope of the workshop is twofold:
We will first develop a solid collaboration to seriously examine and compare the accuracy and efficiency of rapidly developing numerical approaches. Then, we focus on enigmatic puzzles in correlated electrons awaiting novel computational and theoretical approaches, such as mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity and realization of quantum spin liquids from theoretical, numerical, and experimental perspectives.
Due to the spread of COVID-19 pandemic all over the world possibly continuing in the coming fall, the international workshop will be held as an online workshop.
